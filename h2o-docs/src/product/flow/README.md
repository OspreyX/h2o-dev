#Introduction

This guide will walk you through how to use H2O-dev's web UI, H2O Flow. To view a demo video of H2O Flow, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=wzeuFfbW7WE" target="_blank">here</a>. 

##About H2O Flow

H2O Flow is an open-source user interface for H2O. It is a web-based interactive computational environment that allows you to combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots, and rich media in a single document, similar to <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target="_blank">iPython Notebooks</a>. 

With H2O Flow, you can capture, rerun, annotate, present, and share your workflow. H2O Flow allows you to use H2O interactively to import files, build models, and iteratively improve them. Based on your models, you can make predictions and add rich text to create vignettes of your work - all within Flow's browser-based environment. 

Flow's hybrid user interface seamlessly blends command-line computing with a modern graphical user interface. However, rather than displaying output as plain text, Flow provides a point-and-click user interface for every H2O operation. It allows you to access any H2O object in the form of well-organized tabular data. 

H2O Flow sends commands to H2O as a sequence of executable cells. The cells can be modified, rearranged, or saved to a library. Each cell contains an input field that allows you to enter commands, define functions, call other functions, and access other cells or objects on the page. When you execute the cell, the output is a graphical object, which can be inspected to view additional details. 

While H2O Flow supports REST API, R scripts, and Coffeescript, no programming experience is required to run H2O Flow. You can click your way through any H2O operation without ever writing a single line of code. You can even disable the input cells to run H2O Flow using only the GUI. H2O Flow is designed to guide you every step of the way, by providing input prompts, interactive help, and example flows.

<a name="Cell"></a>
# Understanding Cell Modes

There are two modes for cells: edit and command. 


##Using Edit Mode
In edit mode, the cell is yellow with a blinking bar to indicate where text can be entered and there is an orange flag to the left of the cell.

![Edit Mode](images/Flow_EditMode.png)
 
<a name="CmdMode"></a>
##Using Command Mode
 In command mode, the flag is yellow. The flag also indicates the cell's format: 

- **MD**: Markdown 
   
   **Note**: Markdown formatting is not applied until you run the cell by clicking the **Run** button or clicking the **Run** menu and selecting **Run**. 

 ![Flow - Markdown](images/Flow_markdown.png)

- **CS**: Code

 ![Flow - Code](images/Flow_parse_code_ex.png)

- **RAW**: Raw format (for code comments)

 ![Flow - Raw](images/Flow_raw.png)

- **H[1-5]**: Heading level (where 1 is a first-level heading)

 ![Flow - Heading Levels](images/Flow_headinglevels.png)

**NOTE**: If there is an error in the cell, the flag is red. 

 ![Cell error](images/Flow_redflag.png)
 
 If the cell is executing commands, the flag is teal. The flag returns to yellow when the task is complete.

##Using Keyboard Shortcuts

Here are some important keyboard shortcuts to remember: 

- Click a cell and press **Enter** to enter edit mode, which allows you to change the contents of a cell. 
- To exit edit mode, press **Esc**. 
- To execute the contents of a cell, press the **Ctrl** and **Enter** buttons at the same time.

The following commands must be entered in [command mode](#CmdMode).  

- To add a new cell *above* the current cell, press **a**. 
- To add a new cell *below* the current cell, press **b**. 
- To delete the current cell, press the **d** key *twice*. (**dd**). 

You can view these shortcuts by clicking **Help** > **Keyboard Shortcuts** or by clicking the **Help** tab in the sidebar. 


##Using Flow Buttons
There are also a series of buttons at the top of the page below the flow name that allow you to save the current flow, add a new cell, move cells up or down, run the current cell, and cut, copy, or paste the current cell. If you hover over the button, a description of the button's function displays. 

 ![Flow buttons](images/Flow_buttons.png)
 
You can also use the menus at the top of the screen to edit the cells, view specific format types (such as input or output), change the cell's format, or run the cell. You can also access troubleshooting information or obtain help with Flow.  
 ![Flow menus](images/Flow_menus.png)

**Note**: To disable the code input and use H2O Flow strictly as a GUI, click the **Cell** menu, then **Toggle Cell Input**. 

Now that you are familiar with the cell modes, let's import some data. 

---

<a name="ImportData"></a>
# Importing Data

If you don't have any of your own data to work with, you can find some example datasets here: 

- <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/resources/publicdata.html"  target="_blank">http://docs.h2o.ai/resources/publicdata.html </a>
- <a href="http://data.h2o.ai" target="_blank">http://data.h2o.ai</a>


There are multiple ways to import data in H2O flow:

- Click the **Assist Me!** button in the **Help** sidebar, then click the **importFiles** link. Enter the file path in the auto-completing **Search** entry field and press **Enter**. Select the file from the search results and select it by clicking the **Add All** link.
 
- You can also drag and drop the file onto the **Search** field in the cell.
  
 ![Flow - Import Files](images/Flow_Import_DragDrop.png)

- In a blank cell, select the CS format, then enter `importFiles ["path/filename.format"]` (where `path/filename.format` represents the complete file path to the file, including the full file name. The file path can be a local file path or a website address. 

After selecting the file to import, the file path displays in the "Search Results" section. To import a single file, click the plus sign next to the file. To import all files in the search results, click the **Add all** link. The files selected for import display in the "Selected Files" section. 

 ![Import Files](images/Flow_import.png)

- To import the selected file(s), click the **Import** button. 

- To remove all files from the "Selected Files" list, click the **Clear All** link. 

- To remove a specific file, click the **X** next to the file path. 

After you click the **Import** button, the raw code for the current job displays. A summary displays the results of the file import, including the number of imported files and their Network File System (nfs) locations. 

 ![Import Files - Results](images/Flow_import_results.png)

##Uploading Data

  ![File Upload Successful](images/Flow_FileUploadPass.png)

Ok, now that your data is available in H2O Flow, let's move on to the next step: parsing. Click the **Parse these files** button to continue. 

---

<a name="ParseData"></a>
# Parsing Data

After you have imported your data, parse the data.

Select the parser type (if necessary) from the drop-down **Parser** list. For most data parsing, H2O automatically recognizes the data type, so the default settings typically do not need to be changed. The following options are available: 

- Auto
- XLS
- CSV
- SVMLight

If a separator or delimiter is used, select it from the **Separator** list. 

Select a column header option, if applicable: 

- **Auto**: Automatically detect header types.
- **First row contains column names**: Specify heading as column names.
- **First row contains data**: Specify heading as data. This option is selected by default.

Select any necessary additional options: 

- **Enable single quotes as a field quotation character**: Treat single quote marks (also known as apostrophes) in the data as a character, rather than an enum. This option is not selected by default. 
- **Delete on done**: Check this checkbox to delete the imported data after parsing. This option is selected by default. 

A preview of the data displays in the "Data Preview" section. 
 ![Flow - Parse options](images/Flow_parse_setup.png)

**Note**: To change the column type, select the drop-down list at the top of the column and select the data type. The options are: 
  - Unknown
  - Numeric
  - Enum
  - Time
  - UUID
  - String
  - Invalid


After making your selections, click the **Parse** button. 


After you click the **Parse** button, the code for the current job displays. 

 ![Flow - Parse code](images/Flow_parse_code_ex.png)
 
Since we've submitted a couple of jobs (data import & parse) to H2O now, let's take a moment to learn more about jobs in H2O.  
 
--- 
 
<a name="ViewJobs"></a>
# Viewing Jobs

Any command (such as `importFiles`) you enter in H2O is submitted as a job, which is associated with a key. The key identifies the job within H2O and is used as a reference.

## Viewing All Jobs

To view all jobs, click the **Admin** menu, then click **Jobs**, or enter `getJobs` in a cell in CS mode. 

 ![View Jobs](images/Flow_getJobs.png)

The following information displays: 

- Type (for example, `Frame` or `Model`)
- Link to the object 
- Description of the job type (for example, `Parse` or `GBM`)
- Start time
- End time
- Run time

To refresh this information, click the **Refresh** button. To view the details of the job, click the **View** button. 

## Viewing Specific Jobs

To view a specific job, click the link in the "Destination" column. 

![View Job - Model](images/Flow_ViewJob_Model.png)

The following information displays: 

- Type (for example, `Frame`)
- Link to object (key)
- Description (for example, `Parse`)
- Status
- Run time
- Progress

**NOTE**: For a better understanding of how jobs work, make sure to review the [Viewing Frames](#ViewFrames) section as well. 
 
Ok, now that you understand how to find jobs in H2O, let's submit a new one by building a model.

- **Force\_load\_balance**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to force extra load balancing to increase training speed for small datasets and use all cores. This option is selected by default. 

- **Single\_node\_mode**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to force H2O to run on a single node for fine-tuning of model parameters. This option is not selected by default. 

- **Replicate\_training\_data**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to replicate the entire training dataset on every node for faster training on small datasets. This option is not selected by default. This option is only applicable for clouds with more than one node. 

- **Shuffle\_training\_data**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to shuffle the training data. This option is recommended if the training data is replicated and the value of **train\_samples\_per\_iteration** is close to the number of nodes times the number of rows. This option is not selected by default. 

- **Missing\_values\_handling**: [(DL)](#DL) Select how to handle missing values (Skip or MeanImputation). The default value is MeanImputation. 

- **Quiet_mode**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to display less output in the standard output. This option is not selected by default.

- **Sparse**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to use sparse iterators for the input layer. This option is not selected by default as it rarely improves performance. 

- **Col_major**: [(DL)](#DL) Check this checkbox to use a column major weight matrix for the input layer. This option can speed up forward propagation but may reduce the speed of backpropagation. This option is not selected by default. 

- **Average_activation**: [(DL)](#DL) Specify the average activation for the sparse autoencoder. The default value is 0. If **Rectifier** is selected as the **Activation** type, this value must be positive. For Tanh, the value must be in (-1,1). 

- **Sparsity_beta**: [(DL)](#DL) Specify the sparsity regularization. The default value is 0. 

- **Max\_categorical\_features**: [(DL)](#DL) Specify the maximum number of categorical features enforced via hashing. The default is unlimited.

- **Reproducible**: [(DL)](#DL) To force reproducibility on small data, check this checkbox. If this option is enabled, the model takes more time to generate, since it uses only one thread. 

- **Export\_weights\_and\_biases**: [(DL)](#DL) To export the neural network weights and biases as H2O frames, check this checkbox. 

- **Class\_sampling\_factors**: ([GLM](#GLM), [DRF](#DRF), [NaiveBayes)](#NB), [GBM](#GBM), [DL](#DL)) Specify the per-class (in lexicographical order) over/under-sampling ratios. By default, these ratios are automatically computed during training to obtain the class balance. There is no default value. This option is only applicable for classification problems and when **Balance_Classes** is enabled. 

- **Seed**: ([K-Means](#Kmeans), [GBM](#GBM), [DL](#DL), [DRF](#DRF)) Specify the random number generator (RNG) seed for algorithm components dependent on randomization. The seed is consistent for each H2O instance so that you can create models with the same starting conditions in alternative configurations. 

- **Prior**: [(GLM)](#GLM) Specify prior probability for y ==1. Use this parameter for logistic regression if the data has been sampled and the mean of response does not reflect reality. The default value is -1. 

- **Max\_active\_predictors**: [(GLM)](#GLM) Specify the maximum number of active predictors during computation. This value is used as a stopping criterium to prevent expensive model building with many predictors.

 ![Flows](images/Flow_flows.png)

## Finding Saved Flows on your Disk
 
By default, flows are saved to the `h2oflows` directory underneath your home directory.  The directory where flows are saved is printed to stdout:
 
```
03-20 14:54:20.945 172.16.2.39:54323     95667  main      INFO: Flow dir: '/Users/<UserName>/h2oflows'
```

To back up saved flows, copy this directory to your preferred backup location.  

To specify a different location for saved flows, use the command-line argument `-flow_dir` when launching H2O:

`java -jar h2o.jar -flow_dir /<New>/<Location>/<For>/<Saved>/<Flows>`  

where `/<New>/<Location>/<For>/<Saved>/<Flows>` represents the specified location.  If the directory does not exist, it will be created the first time you save a flow.

## Saving Flows on a Hadoop cluster

**Note**: If you are running H2O Flow on a Hadoop cluster, H2O will try to find the HDFS home directory to use as the default directory for flows. If the HDFS home directory is not found, flows cannot be saved unless a directory is specified while launching using `-flow_dir`:

`hadoop jar h2odriver.jar -nodes 1 -mapperXmx 1g -output hdfsOutputDirName -flow_dir hdfs:///<Saved>/<Flows>/<Location>`  

The location specified in `flow_dir` may be either an hdfs or regular filesystem directory.  If the directory does not exist, it will be created the first time you save a flow.

## Duplicating Flows

To create a copy of the current flow, select the **Flow** menu, then click **Make a Copy**. The name of the current flow changes to "Copy of <FlowName>" (where <FlowName> is the name of the flow). You can save the duplicated flow using this name by clicking **Flow** > **Save**. 


## Downloading Flows

After saving a flow as a notebook, click the **Flow** menu, then select **Download...**. A new window opens and the saved flow is downloaded to the default downloads folder on your computer. The file is exported as `<filename> .flow`, where `<filename>` is the name specified when the flow was saved. 

**Caution**: You must have an active internet connection to export flows. 

## Loading Flows

To load a saved flow, click the **Flows** tab in the sidebar at the right. In the pop-up confirmation window that appears, select **Load Notebook**, or click **Cancel** to return to the current flow. 

 ![Confirm Replace Flow](images/Flow_confirmreplace.png)

After clicking **Load Notebook**, the saved flow is loaded. 

To load an exported flow, click the **Flow** menu and select **Open...**. In the pop-up window that appears, click the **Choose File** button and select the exported flow, then click the **Open** button. 

 ![Open Flow](images/Flow_Open.png)

**Notes**: 
- Only exported flows using the default .flow filetype are supported. Other filetypes will not open. 
- If the current notebook has the same name as the selected file, a pop-up confirmation appears to confirm that the current notebook should be overwritten.
