# PCA Tutorial

This tutorial walks new users through the process of creating a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) model. 

Those who have never used H2O before should refer to <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/flow/README.md" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> for additional instructions on how to run H2O Flow.

For more details on the math behind H2O's implementation of PCA, refer to <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/datascience/pca.html" target="_blank">PCA Data Science</a>.


### When to Use PCA
PCA is used to reduce dimensions and solve issues of multicollinearity in high dimension data.

### Getting Started

This tutorial uses a publicly available data set that can be found at:
<a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia" target="_blank">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia</a>.

The original data are the Arrhythmia data set made available by UCI
Machine Learning Repository. They are composed of 452 observations and
279 attributes.

To further explore H2O's capabilities, some <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/resources/publicdata.html" target="_blank">publicly available data sets</a> can be found on our website. 

####Importing Data
Before creating a model, import data into H2O:

0. Click the **Assist Me!** button in the *Help* tab in the sidebar on the right side of the page. 

  ![Assist Me button](../images/AssistButton.png)
0. Click the **importFiles** link and enter the file path to the dataset in the **Search** entry field, or drag and drop the file onto the **Search** entry field and press Enter to confirm the drop. 
0. Click the **Add all** link to add the file to the import queue, then click the **Import** button.

####Parsing Data
Now, parse the imported data: 

0. Click the **Parse these files...** button. 
**Note**: The default options typically do not need to be changed unless the data does not parse correctly. 
0. From the drop-down **Parser** list, select the file type of the data set (Auto, XLS, CSV, or SVMLight). 
0. If the data uses a separator, select it from the drop-down **Separator** list. 
0. If the data uses a column header as the first row, select the **First row contains column names** radio button. If the first row contains data, select the **First row contains data** radio button. You can also select the **Auto** radio button to have H2O automatically determine if the first row of the dataset contains the column names or data. 
0. If the data uses apostrophes ( `'` - also known as single quotes), check the **Enable single quotes as a field quotation character** checkbox. 
0. To delete the imported dataset after the parse is complete, check the **Delete on done** checkbox. 

  **NOTE**: In general, we recommend enabling this option. Retaining data requires memory resources, but does not aid in modeling because unparsed data canâ€™t be used by H2O.


0. Review the data in the **Data Preview** section, then click the **Parse** button.

  **NOTE**: Make sure the parse is complete by clicking the **View Job** button and confirming progress is 100% before continuing to the next step, model building. For small datasets, this should only take a few seconds, but larger datasets take longer to parse.


### Building a Model

0. Once data are parsed, click the **Assist Me!** button, then click **buildModel**. 
0. Select `Principal Component Analysis` from the drop-down **Select an algorithm** menu, then click the **Build model** button. 
0. If the parsed arrhythmia.hex file is not already listed in the **Training_frame** drop-down list, select it. Otherwise, continue to the next step. 
0. From the **Ignored_columns** section, select the columns to ignore in the *Available* area to move them to the *Selected* area. For this example, do not select any columns.  
0. In the **K** field, specify the number of clusters. For this example, enter `3`.  
0. In the **Max_iterations** field, specify the maximum number of iterations. For this example, enter `100`. 
0. From the drop-down **Init** menu, select the initialization mode. For this example, select **PlusPlus**. 
   - PlusPlus initialization chooses one initial center at random and weights the random selection of subsequent centers so that points furthest from the first center are more likely to be chosen. 
   - User initialization requires the corresponding **User_points** parameter. To define a specific initialization point, select the imported dataset .hex file from the drop-down **User_points** list, then select **User** from the drop-down **Init** list.
   
     **Note**: The user-specified points dataset must have the same number of columns as the training dataset.  

0. Click the **Build Model** button.

### PCA Results

PCA output returns a table displaying the number of components
indicated by whichever criteria was more restrictive in this
particular case. In this example, a maximum of 100 components were
requested, and a tolerance set to .5.

Scree and cumulative variance plots for the components are returned as
well. Users can access them by clicking on the black button labeled
"Scree and Variance Plots" at the top left of the results page. A
scree plot shows the variance of each component, while the cumulative
variance plot shows the total variance accounted for by the set of
components.

Users should note that if they wish to replicate results between H2O
and R, it is recommended that standardization and cross validation
either be turned off in H2O, or specified in R.
