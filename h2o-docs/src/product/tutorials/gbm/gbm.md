# GBM Tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to walk new users through a GBM analysis in H2O Flow. 

Those who have never used H2O before should refer to <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-dev/blob/master/h2o-docs/src/product/flow/README.md" target="_blank">Getting Started</a> for additional instructions on how to run H2O Flow.

For more details on the math behind H2O's implementation of GBM, refer to <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/datascience/gbm.html" target="_blank">GBM Data Science</a>. 


## Getting Started

This tutorial uses a publicly available data set that can be found at:
<ahref="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia" target="_blank">http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia</a>.

The original data are the Arrhythmia data set made available by UCI
Machine Learning repository. They are composed of
452 observations and 279 attributes.

To further explore H2O's capabilities, some <a href="http://docs.h2o.ai/resources/publicdata.html" target="_blank">publicly available data sets</a> can be found on our website. 


###Importing Data
Before creating a model, import data into H2O:

0. Click the **Assist Me!** button in the *Help* tab in the sidebar on the right side of the page. 
  ![Assist Me button](../images/AssistButton.png)
0. Click the **importFiles** link and enter the file path to the dataset in the **Search** entry field, or drag and drop the file onto the **Search** entry field and press Enter to confirm the drop. 
0. Click the **Add all** link to add the file to the import queue, then click the **Import** button. 
  ![Importing Files](../images/GBM_ImportFile.png)



###Parsing Data
Now, parse the imported data: 

0. Click the **Parse these files...** button. 
**Note**: The default options typically do not need to be changed unless the data does not parse correctly. 
0. From the drop-down **Parser** list, select the file type of the data set (Auto, XLS, CSV, or SVMLight). 
0. If the data uses a separator, select it from the drop-down **Separator** list. 
0. If the data uses a column header as the first row, select the **First row contains column names** radio button. If the first row contains data, select the **First row contains data** radio button. You can also select the **Auto** radio button to have H2O automatically determine if the first row of the dataset contains the column names or data. 
0. If the data uses apostrophes ( `'` - also known as single quotes), check the **Enable single quotes as a field quotation character** checkbox. 
0. To delete the imported dataset after the parse is complete, check the **Delete on done** checkbox. 

  **NOTE**: In general, we recommend enabling this option. Retaining data requires memory resources, but does not aid in modeling because unparsed data canâ€™t be used by H2O.


0. Review the data in the **Data Preview** section, then click the **Parse** button.

  **NOTE**: Make sure the parse is complete by clicking the **View Job** button and confirming progress is 100% before continuing to the next step, model building. For small datasets, this should only take a few seconds, but larger datasets take longer to parse.



### Building a Model

0. Once data are parsed, click the **Assist Me!** button, then click **buildModel**. 
0. Select `Gradient Boosting Machine` from the drop-down **Select an algorithm** menu, then click the **Build model** button. 
0. If the parsed arrhythmia.hex file is not already listed in the **Training_frame** drop-down list, select it. Otherwise, continue to the next step. 
0. From the **Ignored_columns** section, select the columns to ignore in the *Available* area to move them to the *Selected* area. For this example, do not select any columns. 
0. From the drop-down **Response** list, select column 1 (`C1`).  
0. Verify the **Do_classification** checkbox is checked. 
0. In the **Ntrees** field, specify the number of trees to build  (for this example, `20`). 
0. In the **Max_depth** field, specify the maximum number of edges between the top node and the furthest node as a stopping criteria (for this example, use the default value of `5`). 
0. In the **Min_rows** field, specify the minimum number of observations (rows) to include in any terminal node as a stopping criteria (for this example, `25`). 
0. In the **Nbins** field, specify the number of bins to use for data splitting (for this example, use the default value of `20`). The split points are evaluated at the boundaries at each of these bins. As the value of **Nbins** increases, the algorithm approximates more closely the evaluation of each individual observation as a split point. The cost of this refinement is an increase in computational time.  
0. In the **Learn_rate** field, specify the tuning parameter (also known as shrinkage) to slow the convergence of the algorithm to a solution, which helps prevent overfitting. For this example, enter `0.3`. 
0. Click the **Build Model** button.

### Viewing GBM Results

To view the results, click the **View** button. GBM output for classification returns the output as a graph: 


![GBM Results](../images/GBM_Output.png)


A graph of the variable importances is also included: 

 ![GBM Variable Importances](../images/GBM_VarImp.png)



To view a confusion matrix showing the mean squared error (MSE) values for each tree, click the **Inspect** button, then click the **output** link. 
  
  ![GBM MSE values](../images/GBM_MSE.png)

For classification models, the MSE is based on the classification error within the tree. For regression models, MSE is calculated from the squared deviances, as it is in standard regressions.


###Viewing Predictions

To view predictions, click the **Predict** button. From the drop-down **Frame** list, select the arrhythmia.hex file and click the **Predict** button.

To view more prediction data, click the **View Prediction Frame** button.
