#H2O-Dev on EC2

 >Tested on Redhat AMI, Amazon Linux AMI, and Ubuntu AMI

##Launch H2O-Dev

+**Note**: Before launching H2O on an EC2 cluster, verify that ports `54321` and `54322` are both accessible by TCP and UDP. 

###Selecting the Operating System and Virtualization Type

Select your operating system and the virtualization type of the prebuilt AMI on Amazon. If you are using Windows, you will need to use a hardware-assisted virtual machine (HVM). If you are using Linux, you can choose between para-virtualization (PV) and HVM. These selections determine the type of instances you can launch.

For more information about virtualization types, refer to [Amazon](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/virtualization_types.html). 

###Configuring the Instance

0. Select the IAM role and policy to use to launch the instance. H2O detects the temporary access keys associated with the instance, so you don't need to copy your AWS credentials to the instances.

0. When launching the instance, select an accessible key pair.

####(Windows Users) Tunneling into the Instance

For Windows users that do not have the ability to use `ssh` from the terminal, either download Cygwin or a Git Bash that has the capability to run `ssh`:

`ssh -i amy_account.pem ec2-user@54.165.25.98`

Otherwise, download PuTTY and follow these instructions:

0. Launch the PuTTY Key Generator. 
0. Load your downloaded AWS pem key file. 
   **Note:** To see the file, change the browser file type to "All". 
0. Save the private key as a .ppk file. 

  ![Private Key](images/ec2_putty_key.png)

0. Launch the PuTTY client. 
0. In the *Session* section, enter the host name or IP address. For Ubuntu users, the default host name is `ubuntu@<ip-address>`. For Linux users, the default host name is `ec2-user@<ip-address>`.

0. Select *SSH*, then *Auth* in the sidebar, and click the **Browse** button to select the private key file for authentication.

0. Start a new session and click the **Yes** button to confirm caching of the server's rsa2 key fingerprint and continue connecting.

###Downloading Java and H2O


0. Download [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html
) (JDK 1.7 or later) if it is not already available on the instance. 
0. To download H2O, run the `wget` command with the link to the zip file available on our [website](http://h2o.ai/download/) by copying the link associated with the **Download** button for the selected H2O-Dev build. 
	
		wget http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o-dev/rel-serre/1/index.html
		unzip h2o-dev-0.2.1.1.zip
		cd h2o-dev-0.2.1.1
		java -Xmx4g -jar h2o.jar
0. From your browser, navigate to `<Private_IP_Address>:54321` or `<Public_DNS>:54321` to use H2O's web interface. 



##Launch H2O-Dev from the Command Line



##Important Notes

Java is a pre-requisite for H2O; if you do not already have Java installed, make sure to install it before installing H2O. Java is available free on the web,
and can be installed quickly. Although Java is required to 
run H2O, no programming is necessary.
For users that only want to run H2O without compiling their own code, [Java Runtime Environment](https://www.java.com/en/download/) (version 1.6 or later) is sufficient, but for users planning on compiling their own builds, we strongly recommend using [Java Development Kit 1.7](www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/) or later. 

After installation, launch H2O using the argument `-Xmx`. Xmx is the
amount of memory given to H2O.  If your data set is large,
allocate more memory to H2O by using `-Xmx4g` instead of the default `-Xmx1g`, which will allocate 4g instead of the default 1g to your instance. For best performance, the amount of memory allocated to H2O should be four times the size of your data, but never more than the total amount of memory on your computer.

##Step-by-Step Walk-Through

1. Download the .zip file containing the latest release of H2O-Dev from the
   [H2O downloads page](http://h2o.ai/download/).

2. From your terminal, change your working directory to the same directory as the location of the .zip file.

3. From your terminal, unzip the .zip file.  For example, `unzip h2o-dev-0.2.1.1.zip`. 

4. At the prompt, enter the following commands:

		cd h2o-dev-0.2.1.1  #change working directory to the downloaded file
		java -Xmx4g -jar h2o.jar #run the basic java command to start h2o

5. After a few moments, output similar to the following appears in your terminal window:
